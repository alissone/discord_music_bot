# discord_music_bot

This is a simple implementation of Discord.py audio interface to playback youtube music through an user's voice channel, made from scratch.


It includes basic search, play and stop functionality, but I'll soon create a queue to let users add music asynchronously



#### Example usage

Join the voice channel the user is currently in
```
$join
```


Play a YouTube link
```
$play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4
```


Search for a YouTube video (will play the first result)
```
$play nickelback
```


Stop playback
```
$stop
```


Leave voice channel
```
$exit
```
